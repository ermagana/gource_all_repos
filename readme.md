These are some modified scripts, taken from the great work of other devlopers and customized to fit my need.

The following are required:
  gource: https://code.google.com/p/gource/
  lsgit: https://github.com/ermagana/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/lsgit

The goal:
  pull down all the repos from a given git account, currently tailored for BitBucket
  search all the repos and attempt to grab users gravatar
  build a combined file of all the git logs to be used for gource
